# strava-ml

Strava is an application that allows the tracking of sports activities, such as running and cycling. This personal 
project will take my own Strava dataset and apply ML techniques taught in Data Driven Computer Science (COMS20011) 
at University of Bristol.

This project will be made up of Jupyter Notebooks so that code and text can be displayed together. For instructions 
on how to interact will the notebooks please refer to the [Jupyter documentation](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/).
